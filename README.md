# color_detection

In this color detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on the image.


The project folder contains 3 files:

<br>Color_detection.py – main source code of our project.</br>
<br>Color.jpg – sample image for experimenting.</br>
<br>Colors.csv – a file that contains our dataset.</br>
<br>screenshot- a screenshot of a result.</br>
